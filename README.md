# Counting Sheep

Counting Sheep is a difficulty mod for Stardew Valley that adds a stamina penalty for not getting enough sleep.

In addition to the usual penalty for passing out, this mod causes you start the day with lower stamina if you get fewer than 8 hours of sleep.

Currently this mod only adds the extra penalty, but the next version will incorporate an alarm clock system allowing the player to sleep in to avoid the stamina penalty at the expense of starting the day later.
